# i485 Analysis Repository

This repository contains scripts and data files used for analyzing and tracking similar cases in the i485 project.

## Repository Contents

- `track_similar_cases.py` – Main Python script that processes case data and identifies similar cases.
- `similar.txt` – Text file containing a list of similar case identifiers.
- `similar_cases_history.csv` – CSV file with historical data of similar cases, useful for trend analysis.


## Usage
